 *	Programmed by Tom Randolph
 *	11 March 2010
 *	Last Updated: 01 Aug 2012
 *	====================================
 *
 *	v01082012	- workaround for MSSQL not providing LastInsertID
 *  v27052012	- added MS SQL Server dsn option
 *	v01112010	- added some documentation and prep() function
 *	v08082010	- removed explicit direct binding
 *	v05082010	- added direct binding of variables
 *				- added reporting of prepared query strings
 *	====================================
 *
 *	There are 8 public functions in this object:
 *		public q
 *		public qwv
 *		public stat
 *		public log
 *		public qwviterations
 *		public qiterations
 *		public getq
 *		public getqwv
 *		public last
 *		public reset
 *		public prep
 *	====================================
 *
 *	There are 13 variables in this object:
 *		private $dsn
 *		private $dbh
 *		private $prepq
 *		private $qsql
 *		private $qiterate
 *		private $prepqwv
 *		private $qwvsql
 *		private $qwvvals
 *		private $qwviterate
 *		protected $log
 *		protected $status
 *	====================================
 *
 *	===========-- q() --================
 *	q stands for "query", hopefully that helps give some context.
 *	q() is called with either an SQL query or an empty string ('').
 *
 *	if q() is called with SQL, the SQL is prepared, executed, and the
 *		database results are returned to where q() was called from, in
 *		associative array form.
 *
 *		Note that the array is 0-indexed _by records returned_.  You must know the name of
 *		the column to reference _the field_.  I'm sure there are ways to
 *		re-index the array (probably with array_values()) but that's
 *		beyond the scope of this documentation
 *
 *		Whenever q() is called with SQL, the private variable $qsql is
 *		updated to contain the SQL.  Also, the private variable $qiterate
 *		is reset to 0, and the private variable $prepq is updated to
 *		contain the PDO prepared statement using the SQL.
 *
 *	if q() is called withOUT SQL, the function attempts to use
 *		the previously prepared PDO object without any changes.
 *
 *	if any errors are encountered, FALSE is pushed onto the protected variable $status
 *	A cryptic message about why the error is set is pushed onto $log
 *		Otherwise, TRUE is pushed to $status and some message is pushed onto $log
 *	====================================
 *
 *	===========-- qwv() --==============
 *	qwv stands for "query with values", hopefully that helps give some context.
 *	qwv() is called with either an SQL query AND an array of values
 *  	or an empty string ('') AND an array of values.
 *
 *	Note that qwv() must be called with a 0-indexed array of values.
 *		array('val1','val2','val3',...) works great for this.
 *
 *	if qwv() is called with SQL, the SQL is prepared, the values are fed in to match
 *		the '?' marks, the statement is executed (in the same call), and the
 *		database results are returned to where qwv() was called from, in
 *		associative array form.
 *
 *		Note that the array is 0-indexed _by records returned_.  You must know the name of
 *		the column to reference _the field_.  I'm sure there are ways to
 *		re-index the array (probably with array_values()) but that's
 *		beyond the scope of this documentation
 *
 *	Note that the SQL passed into qwv() must have an equivalent number of '?' marks
 *		to match the values passed in.  If they don't match, horrible things will happen.
 *
 *		Whenever qwv() is called with SQL, the private variable $qwvsql is
 *		updated to contain the SQL.  Also, the private variable $qwviterate
 *		is reset to 0, and the private variable $prepqwv is updated to
 *		contain the PDO prepared statement using the SQL.
 *
 *	if qwv() is called withOUT SQL, the function attempts to use
 *		the previously prepared SQL ($qwvsql) and inserts the new data passed in through
 *		the $values parameter.
 *
 *	if any errors are encountered, FALSE is pushed onto the protected variable $status
 *	A cryptic message about why the error is set is pushed onto $log
 *		Otherwise, TRUE is pushed to $status and some message is pushed onto $log
 *	====================================
 *
 *	============-- stat() --============
 *	This function returns elements from the status array.
 *	If you send an actual #, the function will return that status index (not recommended)
 *	If you send TRUE, the function will return the last status entry
 *				[If you send nothing, it does that too]
 *	If you send the string 'yes', the function will return the whole damn status array to you
 *	(REALLY not recommended)
 *	====================================
 *
 *	 ===========-- log() --=============
 *	This function returns elements from the log array.
 *	If you send an actual #, the function will return that log index (not recommended)
 *	If you send TRUE, the function will return the last log entry
 *				[If you send nothing, it does that too]
 *	If you send the string 'yes', the function will return the whole damn log to you.
 *	====================================
 *
 *	  =========-- qwviterations() --==
 *	   ========-- qiterations() --===
 *	These functions return their respective variables to the calling location.
 *	====================================
 *
 *	 ===========-- getq() --===========
 *	   ========-- getqwv() --========
 *	These functions return the prepared query string for their respective query types
 *	====================================
 *
 *	 ===========-- last() --============
 *	This function will return the id of the last insert as a string.
 *	====================================
 *
 *	 ===========-- reset() --============
 *	This function resets every stored value in the object as if it were being called for the
 *		first time, including "remembering" the passed database type, and handling it
 *		according to how it would be handled on the first __construct call.
 *		reset() does NOT reset the database information (user, pass, db name, location, db type)
 *	=====================================
 *
 *	 ===========-- prep() --============
 *	This function allows the calling script to prepare an SQL statement without actually
 *		executing the statement on the database.  This would typically be used where the
 *		calling script would loop through some data on a single statement using something
 *		similar to:
 *			$db->qwv(null,$data);
 *		Because the qwv() function uses previously prepared SQL if it's first argument is null,
 *		a loop using this function would be inefficient if it had to prepare SQL once, then
 *		use null every time after.
 *		To limit this inefficiency, the calling script could be similar to:
 *			$db->prep($sql, 1);
 *			loop
 *			{
 *				$db->qwv(null, $data);
 *			}
 *
 *		prep() takes two arguments:
 *			First, the SQL statement to be prepared ($sql)
 *			The second argument is answers the question "With Values?" ($wv)
 *				If the second argument is true (1), the prepared SQL is treated as a filler for
 *					$prepqwv.
 *				If the second statement is false (0), the prepared SQL is treated as filler for
 *					$prepq.
 *				$wv defaults to true (1)
